# Shared Orderbook: Relayer-to-Relayer Order Matching Protocol

## Motivation

Currently, a maker and taker must submit orders to the **same relayer** for matching to occur. If multiple relayers operate independently, liquidity is fragmented — orders on Relayer A can't match with orders on Relayer B.

This design document proposes a **shared orderbook** that enables cross-relayer matching, modeled after the Steam trading bot ecosystem.

## Reference: Steam Trading Bot Ecosystem

Steam bots trade game items (CS2 skins, etc.) through centralized marketplaces:

| Component | Steam | zkScatter (proposed) |
|-----------|-------|---------------------|
| Central market | CSGOFloat, Buff163 | Shared Orderbook Server |
| Bot | Trading bot (per operator) | Relayer (per operator) |
| Item listing | Bot registers inventory via API | Relayer posts order summary via API |
| Matching | Market matches buyer/seller | Orderbook matches maker/taker |
| Settlement | Steam Trade Offer | settlePrivate() with ZK proof |
| Fee | Market takes 2-5% | FeeVault (platform fee on claim) |
| Escrow | Steam Guard holds items | CommitmentPool holds commitments |

Key insight: Steam bots don't share private inventory data with each other. They share **public listings** through a central market, and settlement happens via Steam's **Trade Offer protocol**.

## Architecture

### What is shared (public)
- Token pair (e.g., WETH → USDC)
- Amount / price
- Order direction (buy/sell)
- Expiry time
- Relayer address + endpoint URL
- Order ID (nonce)

### What stays private (per-relayer)
- `ownerSecret`, `salt`, `balance` — commitment secrets
- EdDSA private key
- Claims structure (recipients, amounts, release times)

```

### Step-by-step

1. **User A** submits full order (with secrets) to **Relayer X**
2. **Relayer X** posts order summary (no secrets) to **Shared Orderbook**
3. **User B** submits full order (with secrets) to **Relayer Y**
4. **Relayer Y** posts order summary → Shared Orderbook detects match
5. Shared Orderbook notifies both relayers: "Match found"
6. **Settlement relayer** is determined (see below)
7. Both users are notified: "Send your secrets to [settling relayer]"
8. Users send secrets to the settling relayer
9. Settling relayer generates ZK proof and calls `settlePrivate()`
10. Fee goes to FeeVault → settling relayer claims, shares with matching relayer

### Settlement Relayer Selection

Options:
- **First-come**: whoever claims the match first settles
- **Maker's relayer**: maker's relayer always settles (maker has priority)
- **Auction**: relayers bid on settlement right (lowest fee wins)
- **Round-robin**: alternate between matched relayers

Recommended start: **Maker's relayer settles** (simplest, maker already trusts their relayer with secrets).

### Fee Sharing

When Relayer X settles a match that Relayer Y found:
- Settlement fee goes to FeeVault credited to Relayer X
- Relayer X owes Relayer Y a **matching fee** (off-chain or on-chain split)

Options:
- Off-chain settlement between relayers (simple, trust-based)
- FeeVault split: credit both relayers proportionally (requires contract change)
- Matching bounty: fixed reward for the relayer that found the match

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Shared Orderbook Server (MVP)

A simple REST API server that relayers connect to:

```
POST /api/orders          — post order summary
GET  /api/orders          — list open orders (with filters)
GET  /api/orders/:pair    — orders for a specific token pair
POST /api/match           — notify match (server-initiated webhook)
DELETE /api/orders/:id    — cancel/expire order
WS   /ws/orders           — real-time order stream (optional)
```

**Order Summary Schema:**
```json
{
  "id": "relayer-nonce",
  "relayer": "0x...",
  "relayerUrl": "https://relayer-x.example.com",
  "sellToken": "0x...",
  "buyToken": "0x...",
  "sellAmount": "1000000000000000000",
  "buyAmount": "2000000000000000000",
  "minFillAmount": "500000000000000000",
  "maxFee": 30,
  "expiry": 1712624000,
  "createdAt": 1712537600
}
```

**Match Notification (webhook to relayers):**
```json
{
  "matchId": "uuid",
  "maker": { "id": "...", "relayer": "0x...", "relayerUrl": "..." },
  "taker": { "id": "...", "relayer": "0x...", "relayerUrl": "..." },
  "settlingRelayer": "0x...",
  "pair": "WETH-USDC",
  "price": "2000"
}
```

### Phase 2: Relayer Integration

Each relayer adds:
1. On order receipt → POST summary to shared orderbook
2. On match notification → notify user "send secrets to settling relayer"
3. On receiving secrets from remote user → generate proof + settle

### Phase 3: User Experience

Frontend changes:
1. User selects relayer as before
2. If match is cross-relayer, UI shows: "Your order matched via [Relayer Y]. Approve secret transfer to [settling relayer]?"
3. User confirms → secrets sent to settling relayer
4. Settlement proceeds normally

### Phase 4: Decentralization (future)

Replace central server with:
- P2P gossip (libp2p)
- On-chain orderbook (L2 only, due to gas)
- Hybrid: on-chain order hashes + off-chain data

## Security Considerations

1. **Secret exposure**: Users must explicitly approve sending secrets to a new relayer
2. **Relayer impersonation**: Shared orderbook must verify relayer identity (signed messages or on-chain registry check)
3. **Order front-running**: Order summaries are public — MEV bots could front-run. Mitigated by relayer binding in ZK proof
4. **DoS**: Rate limiting on shared orderbook API
5. **Stale orders**: Automatic expiry + heartbeat from relayers

## Non-Goals (for now)

- Partial fills (matching part of an order)
- Multi-relayer settlement (splitting proof generation across relayers)
- On-chain orderbook
- Encrypted order summaries
